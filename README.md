# Sampling: Expenditure per capita of entrepreneurs in DKI Jakarta in 2020

## Introduction
DKI Jakarta is known as one of the provinces that has thriving entrepreneurial activity in various sectors such as fashion, food & beverage, service, technology, etc. However, in 2020, Indonesia faced economic challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including DKI Jakarta. The widespread disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic forced many businesses to adapt to survive and put the resilience of businesses and entrepreneurs in all over the world to the test, making it a year of significant change.

This study will try to understand how entrepreneurs spend their money during that time. By analysing entrepreneurs' spending throughout 2020, it will reveal how they adapted to the new normal, which can guide future economic resilience efforts.

## Samplign Design

**Population**
- First Stage: All regencies/cities in DKI Jakarta
- Second Stage: All districts in regencies/cities in DKI Jakarta
- Third Stage: All entrepreneurs/self-employed individuals in districts in DKI Jakarta

The target population includes all individuals who are entrepreneurs or self-employed workers in DKI Jakarta where I used the data from [Jakarta Bureau of Statistics](https://jakarta.bps.go.id/).

The sampling unit that I used is:
- First Stage: All regencies/cities in DKI Jakarta
- Second Stage: All districts in regencies/cities in DKI Jakarta
- Third Stage: All entrepreneurs/self-employed individuals in districts in DKI Jakarta

So, the observation unit for this study is entrepreneurs in DKI Jakarta, as they are the subjects from whom data on per capita spending will be collected and the analysis units is at the level of entrepreneurs. While, the characteristic under this study is the expenditure per capita of entrepreneurs in DKI Jakarta. Our main area of interest is expenditure per capita.

The sampling method used is multistage sampling, involving several steps to create a representative sample. 

The flow diagram can be seen below:

The sampling process will encompass a total of four stages, including:
— Stage 1: Dividing the population into two strata (Gender)

— Stage 2: Dividing the population into five strata (City)

— Stage 3: Cluster sampling for sub-district within each stratum

— Stage 4: Sampling using Simple Random Sampling method or SRS

## Data Collection Process

The data collection method for per capita expenditure in DKI Jakarta in 2020 involves phone and online messenger surveys, offering cost-effective and efficient alternatives to traditional methods. However, ensuring a representative sample and interviewer skills are essential considerations, while cost, availability, willingness to participate, and response accuracy are factors to be taken into account when using these methods.


## Analysis and Conclusion
The sampling design highlights the importance of prior knowledge in informed parameter assumptions and employs a multistage approach, including gender-based stratification and cluster sampling at the subdistrict level. The calculations suggest that 1,060 samples are needed, with a reasonable total cost of Rp. 104,250,000 for survey needs. A flexible data collection method, combining phone and online messenger channels, enhances resource allocation and surveyor flexibility while ensuring effective data collection.

The advantages of this sampling design include increased efficiency, broader geographic coverage, diversity in the sample, and more effective resource allocation. It is particularly useful for large and widely dispersed populations like DKI Jakarta. However, it comes with disadvantages such as increased complexity in design and execution, the potential for bias at each stage, and higher costs compared to simpler sampling methods. These trade-offs should be carefully considered when choosing a sampling approach.
